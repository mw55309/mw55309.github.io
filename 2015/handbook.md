# Day 1: Group Lectures and Discussion (afternoon only)

  - History of second/third generation sequencing, nanopore in context
  - Introduction to nanopore sequencing
  - Introduction to applications (focus on microbial applications)
  - Understanding nanopore data
  - Nanopore workflow
  - Group session: Designing a nanopore experiment

Dinner out in Birmingham.

## Rotating Schedule

Days 2-4 are operated in rotation. Students will be split into three groups. The
groups will rotate daily through i) library preparation ii) sequencing and 
iii) bioinformatics.

# Day 2: Library Preparation

## Run by Josh Quick and Justin O'Grady

Library prep:

  - Sample input considerations
  - Fresh, frozen, FFPE
  - Protocols (Native, PCR, PreCR, Low-input)
  - Run through SQK-MAP-006 on different samples (as above)
  - Josh run through and then students attempt their own

Student organised dinner.

# Day 3: Sequencing

## Run by Matt Loose and John Tyson

Sequencing:

  - Configuring laptop correctly
  - Using MinKNOW
  - Loading the instrument
  - Understanding MinKNOW
  - Interpreting platform QC
  - Interrogating runs in progress
  - Discussion of read until - perhaps live version if I can.
  - Metrichor
  - Data management strategies
  - Interrogation of ongoing runs: minoTour, poretools

Student organised dinner.

# Day 4: Bioinformatics

## Run by Nick Loman and Mick Watson

  - Initial data handling:
  - Organisation of raw reads (poRe/Poretools)
  - Extraction of FASTQ/A data (poRe/Poretools/minoTour)
  - Gathering and visualization of run statistics (poRe/Poretools/minoTour!)
  - Error correction and quality control (Nanocorr, NanoOK)
  - Alignment of reads (Last, BWA, marginAlign)
  - Event alignment (Nanopolish) - variant calling
  - Scaffolding of short reads (SSPACE-LongRead)
  - Hybrid de novo assembly (SPAdes)
  - Discussion of pure de novo assembly (Celera, nanopolish)

Dinner with instructors.

# Day 5: Wrap-up, discussion (morning only)
